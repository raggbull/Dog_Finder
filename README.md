# Dog_Finder
:sunglasses:

Find your four legged friend here:  https://blooming-thicket-97258.herokuapp.com/


**Overview**

In this activity, you'll build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app but I changed it to find the perfect dog for you. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.
